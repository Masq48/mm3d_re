This repo is mainly for savedata format RE, with mm3d. Documentation of crashes are included here too. This includes a tool for updating the CRC. Note that this repo contains in-game spoilers.

All process-memory addresses in this repo are for the original gamecard USA app.

* "mm3d_savetool.c" This is the savedata CRC-update tool mentioned above.
* "mm3d_notes" This is where the savedata + crashes notes are stored.
* "itemtable_dump": Parsed output of the tables involved with every u8 value for the itemids, see also "mm3d_notes".
